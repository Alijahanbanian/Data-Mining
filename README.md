The goal of writing this code is to determine whether there is a relationship between debugging in programming and the consumption of caffeine (coffee) at different times or not. First, in the initial section, we import libraries in the following order:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib.pyplot (for plotting graphs)
PCA (used for dimensionality reduction of data)
Then, in the "csv_read" section, based on the specified command, we read the dataset from the file and store it in the variable df.

In the next part, we can observe different aspects of the dataset using commands such as "head" and "tail." Specifically, using the "head" command, we see the first five rows of the dataset, and similarly, with the "tail" command, we see the last five rows.

Additionally, the "shape" command allows us to view the dimensions of the data in our dataset, where here the number of columns is 9, and the number of rows is 100.

The "dtype" command is used to check the data types, revealing that in this dataset, there are only two types: int and object.

Furthermore, the "info" command provides information about the data types and their counts in the dataset.
With the "isnull" command, we can view empty data, which is displayed in the table as "True." Following the "isnull" command, the "sum" command can show the count of these null values. These null values, along with less important data, should be handled, and when we refer to removing null data, it usually means replacing them.

With these commands, we identify the NaN (Not a Number) values and replace them with their mode. Then, we find the count of duplicate entries and their indices (Index) and proceed to remove them.

Next, in the subsequent section, we observe that the "Country" column is uniform throughout the entire dataset and has no impact on the result. Therefore, we delete the entire column.

Considering our initial goal, which was mentioned at the beginning, we sort the table. In other words, it can be said that "coffesolvebug" is our target, and the remaining parts of the dataset are our input data.

Using the "describe" command, numerical data can be found, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. However, due to most of our data being nominal, it is challenging to find the mean and standard deviation for them. Additionally, working with nominal data for testing and training is difficult. Therefore, we convert nominal data to numerical data.

To obtain labels, we can first use the "groupby" command to display the types of different data in each column along with their counts in a list. Additionally, we can use the "transform_fit.encode_label" command to convert each of them into a number. However, it is better to use the "mask" method manually. Although the values are still of type object, in the end, they need to be converted to numbers using the "numeric_to" command. Afterward, our data is ready for testing and training.

Finally, we use the "dtype" command to determine whether the converted values are of type int or not.
To ensure that our result is "coffesolveBugs," we concatenate the items using the "concat" command to display them at the end.

Now, to examine the data before testing and training, we process the data and use specific commands to draw pairplot, boxplot, and histogram plots. However, when looking closely at the plots, we see that the categorization is not as expected. This might be due to the deletion of the "Country" data, as removing it may not have been the best choice due to the small size of our dataset.

Now, let's move on to the testing and training stage. First, we put all the dataset except our target into the variable "x," and we place the target column in "y." In the next part, we need to define the values for the test and train sets. If "state_Random" is an integer, the values of the test and train data remain constant in all steps. In this example, we consider 85% of the data as training and 15% as testing.

Then, we print the shape, which shows the number of test and train data along with their dimensions. If we want to reduce dimensions, we can use the PCA library.

Next, we use a decision tree and measure accuracy, which shows high accuracy based on the data. Then, we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to check the result, which may not have as high accuracy.
